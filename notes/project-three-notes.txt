Hello,

I am a student at Georgia Tech. I am working on my final project for the class. The project requires usage of various job search api's and I thought that yours was a good fit for the requirements. Is it possible to be granted access to an API key so that I can use a query URL related to your website within my project?

My number is 404-660-8629
My email is austingraphicandweb@gmail.com

Thank you!

All routes will be in the backend in MERN for the project
