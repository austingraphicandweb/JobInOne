Job sites to place api calls to:
1. Monster

1. MVP
	User puts information into a form, an api call is made, and results are returned for the user to see.
2. User Authentication
3. Saving results option


Elevator pitch:
Now you can go to one page, fill out specific search parameters, and quickly search multiple job boards all in one place so that you do not have to flip from tab to tab in your browser.

All routes will be in the backend in MERN for the project
